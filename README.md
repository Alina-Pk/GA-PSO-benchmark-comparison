# Comparative Study of GA and PSO on Multi-Dimensional Benchmark Functions

This project presents a comparative analysis between Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) on three benchmark functions (Sphere and Rastrigin) in dimensions 10, 20, and 30.

## üîç Overview

The objective is to evaluate and compare the performance of GA and PSO in optimizing continuous functions under varying complexity. We measured performance in terms of best value achieved, average performance, and execution time.
